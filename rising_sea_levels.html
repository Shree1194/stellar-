            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Rising sea levels are primarily caused by **global warming**, leading to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, and the thermal expansion of seawater as it warms. Sea level rise increases the risk of coastal flooding, erosion, and the displacement of communities. Coastal areas around the world are vulnerable, with millions of people potentially being forced to move from their homes.</p>
            <p>According to NASA, sea levels have risen by approximately 20 cm over the last century, and this rate is accelerating. Experts predict a further rise of up to 1 meter by 2100 if no significant measures are taken.</p>

        <section id="real-life">
            <h2>Real-Life Incidents</h2>
            <p>Sea level rise is already affecting communities around the world:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Miami, Florida:</strong> Miami regularly experiences **"sunny day flooding,"** where high tides cause streets to flood even without rain. The city is investing heavily in infrastructure to cope with rising waters.</li>
                <li><strong>Venice, Italy:</strong> Venice is known for its flooding, but the frequency of **"acqua alta"** (high water) events is increasing as sea levels rise. In 2019, Venice faced some of its worst flooding in over 50 years.</li>
                <li><strong>The Maldives:</strong> This island nation in the Indian Ocean is one of the most vulnerable countries to sea level rise. It could become uninhabitable by 2100 if global temperatures continue to rise at current rates.</li>

        <!-- Solution Section -->
        <section id="solution">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <p>Several approaches can help mitigate the effects of sea level rise:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</strong> One of the most effective solutions is to reduce carbon emissions through renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Building Coastal Defenses:</strong> Countries can invest in **sea walls, levees**, and other infrastructure to protect vulnerable coastal areas from flooding and erosion.</li>
                <li><strong>Restoring Natural Buffers:</strong> Natural coastal ecosystems such as **mangroves, coral reefs, and wetlands** can act as buffers against storm surges and flooding, helping to protect inland areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Relocation of Communities:</strong> In extreme cases, relocating vulnerable communities from low-lying areas to safer regions may be necessary.</li>
            </ul>
